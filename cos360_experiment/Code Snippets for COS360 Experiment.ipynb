    "# Phase 1: Introduction\n",
    "Participants are faced with a multi-armed bandit problem where they sample pill containers. In this experiment, they act as scientists trying to treat ten diseased rats. They are told that these rats have a 50% chance of living and are able to draw potentially-curing pills from three distinct containers. After they draw a pill, they feed it to a rat and get a result pertaining to whether the rat lived or died. Their job is to make an scientific assessment about contents of each container.\n",
    "\n",
    "What the participants don't know is that all three containers contain placebo pills. No matter which container they choose from, the rat has a 50% chance of living. The participants have a limited amount of draws and are incentivized not only to produce accurate assessments and save the lives of their rats, but also to be published. This project aims to capture the “reproducibility crisis” in science, which is fundamentally a problem of over-reporting spurious results. Our question is \"Why does information aggregation in science lead to a reproducibility crisis?\" Our hypothesis is that different simulation settings will affect the frequency of false results being published."
